	<h1>Typography is a tool of communication. It must be communication in its most intense form. 

	<h2>The emphasis must be on absolute clarity since this distinguishes the character of our own writing from that of ancient pictographic forms. 

	<h3>Our intellectual relationship to the world is individual-exact (e.g.,this individual-exact relationship is in a state of transition toward a collective-exact orientation).

	<h4>This is in contrast to the ancient individual-amorphous and later collective- amorphous mode of communication. 

	<h5>Therefore priority: unequivocal clarity in all typographical compositions. 

	<h6>Legibility-communication must never be impaired by an a priori aesthetics.
